This repository contains the code written by me, Renaud Brien, for my PhD Thesis : "Security, Privacy and Performance Improvements for Fuzzy Extractors".
The thesis was done at the University of Ottawa.

It contains code for: 
	- Sutcu's Original Fuzzy Extracor
	- Our Improved Fuzzy Extractor
	- Our prososed LDLC Fuzzy Extractor
	- And an Implementation of an single Gaussian message LDLC decoder. 

This code was not made to be easily portable, as it exists purely for testing purposes.
